# Object.toQueryString Plugin for Prototype

The built in `Object.toQueryString` can't handle nested dicts, so this plugin can. We override the built in function so that `Ajax.Request` and other functions that use it Just Workâ„¢. It behaves the same as the built in function for single dimensional dicts.

## Usage

	Object.toQueryString({"foo": "bar"}) // => "foo=bar"
	Object.toQueryString({"qux": {"corge": "grault"}, "garply": "waldo"}) // => "qux%5Bcorge%5D=grault&garply=waldo"

## Tests

Open `spec/dom.html` in your browser to run the test suite.
